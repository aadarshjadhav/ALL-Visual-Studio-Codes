        In a Promise, the resolve function is used to fulfill the promise successfully. 
        When you call resolve(), it signals that the asynchronous operation represented by the promise 
        has completed successfully. The then method is a way to attach callbacks that will be executed 
        when the promise is resolved. It takes two arguments: the first one is the success callback, 
        and the second one (optional) is the error callback

        JavaScript uses a concept called "function hoisting," which means that function declarations are 
        moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. However, if you have 
        multiple functions with the same name, the last one defined will override any previous declarations.
